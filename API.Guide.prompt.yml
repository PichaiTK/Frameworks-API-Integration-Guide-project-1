      Meeting Transcript

      Date: October 25, 2023

      Time: 10:00 AM – 11:30 AM

      Attendees: Aisha, Carlos, Mei-Lin, Jamal, Chloe, Ravi, Elena, Michael,
      Fatima, Liam


      Facilitator: Carlos

      Scribe: Mei-Lin


      Carlos: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining on time. Let's get
      started. The agenda today is project updates, aligning deadlines for Q4
      deliverables, and planning the next sprint. Anything else we need to add
      before diving in?


      Chloe: Yeah, if we have time at the end, let's discuss the feedback we got
      from the client demo.


      Carlos: Got it. We'll add that to the tail end if we have time. Let's
      start with project updates. Aisha?


      Aisha: Sure. The API integration is almost done—about 80% complete. The
      main issue is the new authentication module. It's slowing us down more
      than expected, but I'm escalating it with the IT team to get support.


      Ravi: On the design side, the UI for the new dashboard is in its final
      stages. We're targeting a handoff to development next Wednesday.


      Fatima: That's great. The sales team is really happy with how things are
      shaping up, but they're waiting on that dashboard prototype before they
      can move forward with client walkthroughs.


      Carlos: Okay, so action items here—Aisha, can you make a JIRA ticket
      outlining the specifics of the authentication issue for better visibility?


      Aisha: Yeah, I'll prioritize that and get it out by the end of the day.


      Carlos: Thanks. Ravi, can you follow up with us by Friday to confirm the
      final handoff date for the UI?


      Ravi: Will do.


      Carlos: Alright, let's move to the next topic—timelines for Q4
      deliverables. Jamal, can you kick us off?


      Jamal: Sure. We've hit a two-week delay on the backend implementation. The
      issue is whether we need to move the entire timeline or if we can compress
      it somewhere else.


      Michael: We might be able to recover some time if we overlap the QA
      process with the internal review stage. It's not ideal, but it's an
      option.


      Elena: I'm a little worried about compromising quality. If QA is rushed
      and bugs slip through, we'll pay for it later. I think we should look at
      using the buffer in the UAT phase instead.


      Carlos: Okay. It sounds like we need a deeper conversation to come up with
      a solution. Elena, Michael, Jamal—can the three of you meet tomorrow to
      revise the timeline and suggest adjustments?


      Elena: Works for me. Let's say 2 PM?


      Michael: That works.


      Jamal: Same here. I'll set something up on the calendar.


      Carlos: Perfect. Let's keep going—sprint priorities. Liam, where are we on
      this?


      Liam: We're seeing a surge in customer support tickets recently, mostly
      related to minor feature bugs. I think addressing the top offenders needs
      to be a key priority in the next sprint.


      Chloe: Agreed. If we can identify, say, the top 10 recurring issues and
      prioritize fixing those, it'll reduce the noise considerably.


      Carlos: Good suggestion. Liam, can you pull that data and filter for the
      most pressing bugs?


      Liam: On it. I'll have it ready for sprint planning on Monday.


      Carlos: Thanks. Now, Chloe, you wanted to bring up feedback from the demo?


      Chloe: Yeah, one of our key clients mentioned that they'd like more
      customization options in the reporting features. They brought it up during
      the Q&A after the demo.


      Fatima: Makes sense. We've heard somewhat similar suggestions in the past.
      I think we should scope it out and see what's feasible in the short term
      versus a future phase.


      Chloe: Fatima, let's sync up after this meeting and figure out what's
      doable.


      Fatima: Sounds good. I'll block some time with you for later today to dive
      into it.


      Carlos: Great. Alright, we covered the agenda. Let's quickly go over the
      action items to make sure we're aligned.


      Mei-Lin: I've got a draft list here. Should I go ahead?


      Carlos: Yes, please.


      Mei-Lin: Okay: Aisha will update JIRA with details on the authentication
      issue by the end of today. Ravi will confirm the UI handoff date by
      Friday. Elena, Michael, and Jamal will meet tomorrow at 2 PM to draft a
      revised timeline. Liam will pull the top 10 recurring bugs for sprint
      planning on Monday. Chloe and Fatima will meet today to review the client
      feedback on reporting. Lastly, I'll send the full meeting notes later
      today.


      Carlos: Perfect. I'll also schedule the next meeting for Wednesday,
      November 1, and get the calendar invite out by the end of the day.


      Michael: Works for me.


      Chloe: Same.


      Carlos: Alright, thanks, everyone. Great work. Let's adjourn. Have a good
      rest of your day!


      Meeting adjourned at 11:25 AM.
