# Licenses included in this repository

This repository includes multiple license texts to make it simple to pick and apply the license that suits your project and its components.

Files provided:
- `LICENSE` — MIT License (recommended default). Short, permissive, widely used.
- `LICENSE.APACHE-2.0` — Apache License 2.0 (if you want patent grant and a few additional protections).
- `LICENSES.md` — this file (you are reading it).

If you want to apply a single license to the entire repository, pick one of the files above and keep it as `LICENSE` at the repository root. The current default `LICENSE` file contains the MIT license and is assigned to the project by default.

Recommended actions:
1. Choose one license (MIT or Apache-2.0) for the project. Remove extra license files if you do not plan to multi-license.
2. Add a short SPDX header to each source file (see `SPDX-HEADERS.txt` for examples).
3. If you accept contributions and want them under the project's license, include a CONTRIBUTING.md that states the contributor license expectations (Contributor License Agreement or DCO).
4. If you plan to dual-license, make that explicit in the repository README and each release.

Notes about licenses:
- MIT is permissive: allows reuse with minimal obligations (must keep copyright & license).
- Apache-2.0 is permissive and includes an explicit patent grant and patent retaliation clause.
- GPL-3.0 (not included as a text file here) is copyleft (derivative works must be licensed under GPL-3.0). If you need GPL, add `COPYING` with the GPL-3.0 text.

SPDX expressions:
- To mark the project as MIT: `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`
- For Apache 2.0: `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`

If you want, I can:
- Replace the repository `LICENSE` with Apache-2.0 or GPL-3.0 in full.
- Add SPDX headers automatically to all TS/JS/PY files in the repo.
- Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` describing contributor license terms (DCO / CLA).
